          <p>Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more
              and more complex programs.<br><br>Functional programming follows a few core principles:<br><br></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation</li><br>
            <li>Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data</li><br>
            <li>Functions have minimal side effects in the program</li>
          </ul><br>
          <p>The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.</p>

            <p class="wrappable">Functional programming is about:</p>

            <p class="wrappable">The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">With that information, we'll need to revisit the <code>getTea</code> function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify <code>getTea</code> to accept a function as a parameter to be able to
              change the type of tea it prepares. This makes <code>getTea</code> more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">But first, let's cover some functional terminology:</p>
            <p class="wrappable"><code>Callbacks</code> are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in <code>filter</code>,
              the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called <code>first class</code> functions. In JavaScript, all
              functions are <code>first class</code> functions.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called <code>higher order</code> functions.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a <code>lambda</code>.</p>

        <header>Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code</header>
        <article>
          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have
              issues.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a <code>for</code> loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the <code>for</code> loop mentioned above, you
              could call the <code>map</code> method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging
              windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for <code>tabOpen()</code>, <code>tabClose()</code>, and <code>join()</code>. The array <code>tabs</code> is part of the Window object that
              stores the name of the open pages.</p>
            <div>
              <h4>Instructions</h4>
              <h4></h4>
            </div>
            <p class="wrappable">Run the code in the editor. It's using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect output. The final list of open tabs should be <code>['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab',
                'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab']</code> but the output will be slightly different.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Work through the code and see if you can figure out the problem, then advance to the next challenge to learn more.</p>

          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the <code>splice</code> call in the <code>tabClose()</code> function. Unfortunately, <code>splice</code> changes the original array
              it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">One of the core principle of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any
              global variable.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the <code>splice</code> method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called <code>mutation</code>, and the outcome is called a <code>side effect</code>. A function, ideally, should be a <code>pure function</code>,
              meaning that it does not cause any side effects.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.</p>

        <article>
          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function <code>incrementer</code> would not work without the global variable <code>fixedValue</code> being there.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into
              the function as an argument.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.</p>

            <p class="wrappable">So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:</p>
            <p class="wrappable">1) Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">2) Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or variable.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.</p>

          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered <code>First Class Objects</code> in JavaScript, which means they can
              be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>, or more simply <code>map</code>.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Remember that the <code>map</code> method is a way to iterate over each item in an array. It creates a new array (without changing the original one) after applying a callback function to every element.</p>

          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">As you have seen from applying <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>, or simply <code>map()</code> earlier, the <code>map</code> method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't
              alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">In other words, <code>map</code> is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">It would teach us a lot about <code>map</code> to try to implement a version of it that behaves exactly like the <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> with a <code>for</code> loop or
              <code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code>.</p>

            <p class="wrappable">Another useful array function is <code>Array.prototype.filter()</code>, or simply <code>filter()</code>. The <code>filter</code> method returns a new array which is at most as long as the original array, but usually
              has fewer items.</p>
            <p class="wrappable"><code>Filter</code> doesn't alter the original array, just like <code>map</code>. It takes a callback function that applies the logic inside the callback on each element of the array. If an element returns true based
              on the criteria in the callback function, then it is included in the new array.</p>

          <p class="wrappable">The <code>slice</code> method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The <code>slice</code> method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.</p>
          <p class="wrappable">Here's an example:</p>
          <div><blockquote>var arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];<br>var newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);<br>// Sets newArray to ["Dog", "Tiger"]</blockquote></div>

          <div class="challenge-instructions functional-programming col-xs-12">
            <p class="wrappable">A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the <code>splice</code> method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to
              start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the <code>splice</code> method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's
              an example:</p>
            <div>
              <blockquote>var cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];<br>cities.splice(3, 1); // Returns "London" and deletes it from the cities array<br>// cities is now ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"]
              </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p class="wrappable">As we saw in the last challenge, the <code>slice</code> method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the <code>slice</code> method takes two
              arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the <code>slice</code> method instead of <code>splice</code> helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

          <p class="wrappable"><code>Concatenation</code> means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the <code>concat</code> method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way.
            For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to <code>concat</code>, which is added to the end of the first array.
            It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. Here's an example:</p>
          <div><blockquote>[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);<br>// Returns a new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</blockquote></div>

              <code>Push</code> adds an item to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:</p>

            <p class="wrappable"><code>Array.prototype.reduce()</code>, or simply <code>reduce()</code>, is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the <code>reduce</code>
              method.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">This is not the case with the <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> methods since they do not allow interaction between two different elements of the array. For example, if you want to compare elements of the
              array, or add them together, <code>filter</code> or <code>map</code> could not process that.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">The <code>reduce</code> method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> can be derived as a special application of
              <code>reduce</code>.</p>

          <p class="wrappable">A side effect of the <code>sort</code> method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place.

            <p class="wrappable">The <code>split</code> method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the
              delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.</p>
            <p class="wrappable">Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:</p>
            <div>
              <blockquote>var str = "Hello World";<br>var bySpace = str.split(" ");<br>// Sets bySpace to ["Hello", "World"]<br><br>var otherString = "How9are7you2today";<br>var byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);<br>// Sets byDigits to ["How",

          <p class="wrappable">The last several challenges covered a number of useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles. We've also learned about <code>reduce</code>, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> are special cases of <code>reduce</code>.</p>
          <p class="wrappable">Let's combine what we've learned to solve a practical problem.</p>
          <p class="wrappable">Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled "Stop Using Reduce", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (".../stop-using-reduce"). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.</p>

            <p class="wrappable">This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next
              argument when it's available. Here's an example using the <code>curried</code> function in the example above:</p>
